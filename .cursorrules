# Cursor Rules for Massive RTS Game Development

- No packages can be installed locally, all dependencies must be set in the code of the game

## üö© Project Context and Goals
- This is a simplified, browser-based RTS game prototype.
- Short match length (1-hour cycles).
- Massively multiplayer with drop-in/drop-out capability.
- Cooperative gameplay: Humans vs. AI-controlled opponents.
- Adaptive difficulty based on human team performance.
- AI-generated variation (maps, NPCs, units) via external APIs.

## üéØ Current Development Phase (Phase 1)
- isometric game map
- Render a procedurally generated terrain on HTML5 Canvas.
- Implement a single controllable unit with camera panning.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Style and Standards
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) or TypeScript (preferred).
- Classes and methods should be modular, small, and clear.
- Favor readability and clarity over cleverness.
- Consistently comment on purpose, not obvious implementation details.

## üóÉÔ∏è Project File Structure (Follow Closely)
- Public assets (HTML, CSS, static files): `/public`
- Source code organized clearly under `/src`

## üìê Class and Object Design Principles
- Classes should represent clearly defined responsibilities.
- Maintain clear separation of concerns:
- Game logic vs. rendering vs. input handling.
- No tight coupling; pass dependencies explicitly.
- Encapsulate logic within relevant classes.


## ‚úÖ Task Completion Criteria
- Clearly state completion criteria for any provided task.
- Verify all provided code meets stated project goals before completing a task.

## üß™ Testing and Validation
- Include basic test cases when implementing new features.
- Recommend Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript tests.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on functionality first.
- Avoid complex state management early on‚Äîstart simply.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies; stick to vanilla JS or minimal libraries.

## üìù Code Comments and Documentation
- Comment all class methods succinctly (single-line description above method).
- Document key decision points or complex logic clearly inline.
- Update README.md whenever major changes or additions occur.

## üîÑ Iterative Development Mindset
- Encourage small, iterative improvements over large, sweeping changes.
- Clearly communicate next steps upon task completion.

## üöß Error Handling and Robustness
- Always provide basic error handling, especially around user inputs and interactions.

## üîé Thought Process Checklist (Before Providing Code)
1. Does the provided code fulfill the requested functionality clearly and simply?
2. Is the code structure consistent with the established file and class structure?
3. Are there clear, actionable next steps provided?
4. Is the scalability considered?
5. Are instructions for testing and validation clear?

## üîó Reference and Reuse
- Always reference and reuse existing project code where possible.

## Ignore Patterns
- **/node_modules/**
- **/dist/**
- **/.git/**

use ./start and ./stop to start and stop the program

DO NOT EVER CREATE ANY NEW FILES UNLESS SPECIFIED BY THE USER.

## PowerShell Best Practices and Common Issues

When working with PowerShell, be aware of these common issues:

1. **Script Execution Path**: Always use `.\scriptname.bat` or `.\scriptname.ps1` in PowerShell to run scripts in the current directory. PowerShell does not include the current directory in its execution path by default (unlike Command Prompt).

2. **Execution Policy**: PowerShell has security restrictions that may prevent script execution. Use `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` to allow local scripts to run.

3. **Command Aliases**: PowerShell commands often have aliases that differ from traditional command-line tools. For example, `ls` in PowerShell is an alias for `Get-ChildItem`, not the Unix `ls` command.

4. **Output Handling**: PowerShell returns objects, not just text. This affects how output is processed and displayed compared to Command Prompt.

5. **Path Separators**: While PowerShell accepts both forward slashes (/) and backslashes (\) in paths, some PowerShell commands may behave unexpectedly with forward slashes.

6. **Command Precedence**: PowerShell follows a specific precedence order when resolving commands: aliases, functions, cmdlets, and then external commands. This can lead to unexpected behavior when commands have the same name.

7. **Parameter Passing**: PowerShell uses different parameter passing conventions than Command Prompt. Use named parameters (e.g., `-ParameterName Value`) for clarity.

8. **Error Handling**: PowerShell has robust error handling with try/catch blocks and the $ErrorActionPreference variable, which is different from Command Prompt's errorlevel checking.

Always test PowerShell scripts in the target environment, as behavior can vary between PowerShell versions and configurations.

## GitHub and Git Best Practices

When working with Git and GitHub, follow these simplified approaches:

1. **Keep Git Commands Simple**: Use the basic commands directly without trying to pipe or filter output:
   - `git add <file>` - Stage specific files
   - `git add .` - Stage all changes
   - `git commit -m "message"` - Commit with a clear message
   - `git push` - Push to the remote repository


3. **Repository Setup (One-time Operations)**:
   - `git clone <url>` - Clone a repository
   - `git remote add origin <url>` - Add a remote
   - `git pull origin master` - Pull from a remote branch

4. **Common Workflows**:
   - New feature: `git add` ‚Üí `git commit` ‚Üí `git push`
   - Get updates: `git pull`
   - Switch branches: `git checkout <branch>`

5. **Error Recovery**:
   - If a command fails, try the simplest alternative
   - When in doubt, use the GitHub Desktop application for visual operations

Remember that Git operations should be straightforward. If you're encountering errors with a complex command, there's usually a simpler way to accomplish the same task.
