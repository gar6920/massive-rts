## GAME OVERVIEW
- This game is a browser based, massively multiplayer real-time strategy game.
- Isometric geometry with tile based map
- Human players vs. AI.
- Short matches no longer than 1 hour.
- Game map and difficulty changes every game, if humans win the map and difficulty will increase, if AI wins the map and difficulty will decrease.
- AI will be involved in creating game (map, other parameters) - later feature.
- At start of game the number of connected clients determines the map size
- Goal is to be able to have hundreds or possibly thousands of players in a single game

## Current State
- Map loads with human and AI base
- Units load and can be selected
- units show movement when right clicked to a destination
- units move and attack a target including following a moving target

## ACTIVE FEATURES WE ARE WORKING ON
- then will work on making buildings - allowing clients (and maybe AI) to make buildings
- work on making more AI units spawn
- make terrain objects of varying sizes and facilitate their import into the map


## Flow of coding in cursor
- request made in agent text by User
- agent attempts to code request
- agent completes request
- user confirms completion
- push to github if works, reset to prior commit if it doesn't work

// cursorrules - Client-Server Responsibility Definition

# Server-Side Responsibilities
- Authoritative management of game state (units, buildings, resources)
- Validation and execution of player commands
- Game logic processing (combat resolution, production timers, resource extraction)
- State synchronization and broadcasting to clients
- Player connection management (join, disconnect, state initialization)

# Client-Side Responsibilities
- Rendering of entities, map, and UI elements
- Input capture and immediate visual feedback for player interactions
- Smooth visual interpolation between server updates (entity movement interpolation)
- User interface management (selection, unit/building status, minimap, HUD)
- Camera viewport handling (scroll, zoom, minimap navigation)
- Efficient resource (image) loading and fallback strategies

## Client-Server Protocol and Interaction
- Clients send requests for actions (movement, building, attacks); server responds with authoritative updates
- Clients perform visual interpolation to smooth transitions between server updates
- Server regularly broadcasts game state snapshots for synchronization
- Clients maintain local prediction for responsiveness, corrected periodically by server updates

## Next Goals

## Rules To Follow
- Only modify client OR server side functionality at a time.  Get permission explicitly if changing from one to the other.
- Do not overcomplicate git commits. .add, commit, push.  Same with reset - reset Head
- Only start and stop program with ./start, ./stop
- Render a procedurally generated terrain on HTML5 Canvas.
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) or TypeScript (preferred).
- Classes and methods should be modular, small, and clear.
- Favor readability and clarity over cleverness.
- Consistently comment on purpose, not obvious implementation details.
- Public assets (HTML, CSS, static files): `/public`
- Source code organized clearly under `/src`
- Classes should represent clearly defined responsibilities.
- Maintain clear separation of concerns:
- Game logic vs. rendering vs. input handling.
- No tight coupling; pass dependencies explicitly.
- Encapsulate logic within relevant classes.
- Comment all class methods succinctly (single-line description above method).
- Encourage small, iterative improvements over large, sweeping changes.
- Clearly communicate next steps upon task completion.
- Always provide basic error handling, especially around user inputs and interactions.
- Always reference and reuse existing project code where possible.


## ðŸ”Ž Thought Process Checklist (Before Providing Code)
1. Does the provided code fulfill the requested functionality clearly and simply?
2. Is the code structure consistent with the established file and class structure?
3. Are there clear, actionable next steps provided?
4. Is the scalability considered?
5. Are instructions for testing and validation clear?

## Ignore Patterns
- **/node_modules/**
- **/dist/**
- **/.git/**

## Commit Handling Guidelines
- When asking to reset to a specific commit, use the exact commit message like: "reset to commit 'tracks enemy down'"
- When multiple similar commits exist, include the date or an additional identifier
- For critical operations like resets or force pushes, explicitly confirm your intention
- Never use git log or git status
