## when server gets full (or saturated to some degree) then a new server should be crated automatically and new players put in appropraite servers.  automatically scaling as needed

## each player unit a hero and maybe he can have or obtain basic units he can control
## players get gold (or points), humans can have shared pot that they can opt to contribute money to, they can also specify things that it could go to and then any human could use that.  or maybe a building template could be put down and then players can opt to spend their gold on that.
