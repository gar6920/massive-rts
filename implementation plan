## Implementation Plan:
const { Room } = require("colyseus");

class GameRoom extends Room {
  onCreate(options) {
    console.log("GameRoom created!");
  }
  onJoin(client) {
    console.log(client.sessionId, "joined!");
  }
  onLeave(client) {
    console.log(client.sessionId, "left!");
  }
}

gameServer.define("game_room", GameRoom);

Why: This creates a room type called “game_room” that handles player connections, replacing your Socket.IO rooms.

Step 4: Set Up the Game State
What to Do: Define the basic game state (like the map and players) for Colyseus to sync.

How:
In colyseusServer.js, add the Schema import and define the state:
javascript

const { Schema, type, MapSchema } = require("@colyseus/schema");

class Player extends Schema {
  @type("number") x = 0;
  @type("number") y = 0;
}

class GameState extends Schema {
  @type({ map: Player }) players = new MapSchema();
}

class GameRoom extends Room {
  onCreate(options) {
    this.setState(new GameState());
    console.log("GameRoom created!");
  }
  // Keep onJoin and onLeave as is
}

Why: The GameState holds the game data (like player positions) that Colyseus will sync to all clients.

Step 5: Add Players to the Game State
What to Do: Give each player a hero unit when they join.

How:
Update the onJoin method in GameRoom:
javascript

onJoin(client) {
  const player = new Player();
  player.x = 50; // Starting position near human base
  player.y = 50;
  this.state.players.set(client.sessionId, player);
  console.log(client.sessionId, "joined!");
}

Add to onLeave:
javascript

onLeave(client) {
  this.state.players.delete(client.sessionId);
  console.log(client.sessionId, "left!");
}

Why: This adds a hero for each player to the game state, tied to their unique session ID.

Step 6: Generate a Simple Map
What to Do: Create a basic map based on the number of players.

How:
Add a map to the GameState:
javascript

class GameState extends Schema {
  @type({ map: Player }) players = new MapSchema();
  @type(["number"]) map = [];
}

Update onCreate in GameRoom:
javascript

onCreate(options) {
  this.maxClients = options.maxPlayers || 4; // Default to 4 players
  this.setState(new GameState());

  const mapSize = this.maxClients * 10; // Simple scaling: 10 tiles per player
  for (let i = 0; i < mapSize * mapSize; i++) {
    this.state.map.push(0); // 0 = empty tile
  }
  console.log("GameRoom created with map size:", mapSize);
}

Why: This makes a square map that grows with the number of players, stored in the game state.

Step 7: Handle Player Movement
What to Do: Let players move their heroes by sending commands to the server.

How:
In GameRoom, add a message handler:
javascript

onCreate(options) {
  // Existing code...
  this.onMessage("move", (client, message) => {
    const player = this.state.players.get(client.sessionId);
    if (player) {
      player.x = message.x;
      player.y = message.y;
    }
  });
}

Why: This lets the server update a player’s hero position when they send a move command.

Step 8: Install Colyseus on the Client
What to Do: Add the Colyseus client library to your game client.

How:
In your client folder, run:
bash

npm install colyseus.js

Why: This lets your client connect to the Colyseus server instead of Socket.IO.

Step 9: Connect the Client to the Server
What to Do: Update your client to join the “game_room”.

How:
In your client code (e.g., game.js), replace Socket.IO with:
javascript

const { Client } = require("colyseus.js");
const client = new Client("ws://localhost:2567");
client.joinOrCreate("game_room").then(room => {
  console.log("Joined game room:", room.sessionId);
  window.gameRoom = room; // Save for later use
}).catch(e => {
  console.error("Join error:", e);
});

Why: This connects your client to the Colyseus server and joins the game room.

Step 10: Show the Game State on the Client
What to Do: Update your client to display the synced game state.

How:
Add a state listener in the client:
javascript

gameRoom.onStateChange((state) => {
  console.log("State updated:", state);
  // Example: Log player positions
  state.players.forEach((player, id) => {
    console.log(`Player ${id} at (${player.x}, ${player.y})`);
  });
  // Update your rendering here (e.g., move sprites)
});

Why: This keeps your client in sync with the server’s game state and lets you render it.

Step 11: Send Movement from the Client
What to Do: Let players move their heroes from the client.

How:
Add a simple move command (e.g., on key press):
javascript

document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  const player = gameRoom.state.players.get(gameRoom.sessionId);
  if (!player) return;

  if (event.key === "ArrowRight") {
    gameRoom.send("move", { x: player.x + 10, y: player.y });
  }
  if (event.key === "ArrowLeft") {
    gameRoom.send("move", { x: player.x - 10, y: player.y });
  }
});

Why: This sends movement inputs to the server, which updates the game state.

Step 12: Test It Out
What to Do: Make sure everything works so far.

How:
Start the server:
bash

node colyseusServer.js

Open two browser windows (or run two clients) and connect to the game.

Move a hero in one window and check if the other window sees it.

Why: Testing ensures players can join, see the map, and move their heroes together.

Step 13: Add More Features Later
What to Do: Build on this foundation with more GDD features.

How:
Add buildings: Send a “build” message and update the state with new entities.

Add units: Similar to heroes, create them in the state when hired.

Add AI: Run simple AI logic in GameRoom to move enemy units.

Add the timer: Track time in GameRoom and check for one hour.

Why: These steps get the basics working first, then you can add complexity gradually.

Why This Works
Easy Transition: You’re moving from Socket.IO to Colyseus one piece at a time, reusing your existing Express server.

Matches the GDD: The plan supports heroes, a scalable map, and multiplayer cooperation.

Simple Steps: Each step is small and testable, so you can see progress quickly.

Start with Step 1 and work through each one. Once you’ve got players moving heroes on a map, you’ll have a solid base to add buildings, units, AI, and the time limit. Let me know if you need help with any step!
